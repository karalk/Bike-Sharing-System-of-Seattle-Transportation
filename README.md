Focusing on the relationship between using the frequency of each station,  where people start their trips and the changing amount of installed and existing docks.  There are 34 stations in total, and the average using frequency for each station is nearly 4460 times.  Splitting stations into two groups, whose using frequencies are above and below the average using frequency, and  concluding that average using frequencies will not directly affect the amount of the docks, maybe as the indirect impact factor.
